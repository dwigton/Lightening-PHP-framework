    <h1>A light weight, home-baked solution</h1>
    <p>The Lightening PHP framework is built to study the trade offs and considerations
        encountered in designing a framework. This study began out of frustration in 
        deciphering some more complex frameworks and from poor choices made whilst
        using more simple frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>Three frameworks have gone into forming the way I think about code for the web
        I am indebted to CodeIgniter, Magento, and of course Rails. There are things
        that I like about each and things I don't like so much.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design philosophy of Lightening is power and flexibility without hiding
        the ball. The user should not have to read core code to understand how to
        proceed, but if they get stuck it should be immediately clear what is going on.
        Magento and Rails do not do a particularly good job of this. CodeIgniter is better
        but still has some clunky bits that just make things ugly at times.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ugliness may be entirely due to my lack of understanding in how the framework
        was intended to be used. This is very likely and deepening my understanding is
        of course why Lightening exists.
