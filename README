Lightning is currently a learning tool. It's development and use are intended 
to be useful in instructing beginners to PHP MVC frameworks, on the design
considerations required in a more advanced framework.

A PHP developer of moderate ability should be able to get started with 
Lightning merely by glancing through the config.php file and the
lightning/view.php files.

Lightning does not want to impose any particular document structure on its
users and as such controllers and views can be organized in anyway desired.
Classes and functions can also follow any naming pattern desired. There are some
defaults for testing but the developer can make any change they like to 
config.php.

Modularity and event observer registering can be accomplished by editing
config.php. While it is good practice to use some sort of convention throughout
a project, no particular file structure is imposed by the module system. 
Lightning merely makes it easy for the programmer to build their own structure.
