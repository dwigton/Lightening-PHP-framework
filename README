Lightening is currently a learning tool. It's development and use are intended 
to be useful in instructing, beginners to PHP MVC frameworks, on the design
considerations required in a more advanced framework.

A PHP developer of moderate ability should be able to get started with 
Lightening merely by glancing through the routes.php file and the
lightening/lightening_view_base.php files.

Lightening does not want to impose any particular document structure on its
users and as such controllers and views can be organized in anyway desired.
Classes and functions can also follow any naming pattern desired. There are some
defaults for testing but the developer can make any change they like to 
routes.php.
